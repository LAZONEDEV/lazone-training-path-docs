# Getting Started with Node.js

Node.js is a platform built on Chrome's V8 JavaScript engine, designed for building fast and scalable network applications. Follow this tutorial to get started with Node.js.

## Step 1: Install Node.js

Start by installing Node.js on your machine. You can download it from the [official Node.js website](https://nodejs.org/).

Check the installation by opening a terminal and running the following commands:
```bash
node -v
npm -v
```
These commands should display the versions of Node.js and npm.

## Step 2: Create a Node.js Project

1. Create a folder for your project:
    ```bash
    mkdir my-node-project
    cd my-node-project
    ```

2. Initialize your Node.js project by creating a `package.json` file. Answer the interactive questions or use the following command:
    ```bash
    npm init -y
    ```

3. You now have a `package.json` file that defines your project.

## Step 3: Create a First JavaScript File

Create a simple JavaScript file, for example, `app.js`, and open it in your favorite text editor.

Add the following code to create a basic HTTP server:
```javascript
const http = require('http');

const server = http.createServer((req, res) => {
  res.writeHead(200, {'Content-Type': 'text/plain'});
  res.end('Hello, this is a Node.js server!\n');
});

const PORT = 3000;
server.listen(PORT, () => {
  console.log(`Server listening on port ${PORT}`);
});
```

## Step 4: Run the Server

Back in your terminal, run the server with the command:
```bash
node app.js
```

Your server is now running at `http://localhost:3000`. Open your browser and visit this URL to see the greeting message.

## Step 5: Use NPM Modules

Node.js uses npm (Node Package Manager) to manage dependencies and third-party modules. For example, install the `express` module to create a more advanced web server:
```bash
npm install express
```

Modify your `app.js` file to use Express:
```javascript
const express = require('express');
const app = express();
const PORT = 3000;

app.get('/', (req, res) => {
  res.send('Hello, this is an Express server!');
});

app.listen(PORT, () => {
  console.log(`Server listening on port ${PORT}`);
});
```
